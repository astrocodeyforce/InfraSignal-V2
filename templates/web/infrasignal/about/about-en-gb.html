<h1>About InfraSignal</h1>

<p>InfraSignal is a civic infrastructure reporting platform that makes it
simple for residents to report and track local problems &mdash; and for
local authorities to receive, prioritize, and resolve them.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>

<p>Across the United States, infrastructure problems like potholes, broken
streetlights, damaged sidewalks, and illegal dumping go unreported because
residents don&rsquo;t know who to contact or how to reach them. InfraSignal
solves this by providing a single, easy-to-use platform that automatically
routes reports to the correct city, county, or state authority based on the
geographic location of the problem.</p>

<p>When a resident submits a report, InfraSignal:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identifies the responsible local authority using official geographic
    boundary data</li>
    <li>Delivers the complete report &mdash; including location, category,
    description, photos, and priority level &mdash; directly to that
    authority</li>
    <li>Keeps the reporter updated with email notifications as the status
    changes</li>
    <li>Publishes the report on a public map so the community has visibility
    into local issues and their resolution</li>
</ol>

<h2>Coverage</h2>

<p>InfraSignal currently serves the entire United States, with
infrastructure reports routed across:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>51 state-level authorities</strong> (all 50 states and the
    District of Columbia)</li>
    <li><strong>Over 3,000 county governments</strong></li>
    <li><strong>More than 25,000 city and town governments</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All jurisdictions receive reports across 13 standardized infrastructure
categories, including pothole / road damage, streetlight outage, drainage /
flooding, graffiti / vandalism, sidewalk damage, bridge / guardrail damage,
traffic signal / sign issues, and more.</p>
