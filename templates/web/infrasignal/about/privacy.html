<h3>1.3 Information from Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>We use third-party services for mapping, geographic boundary lookups,
automated image moderation, and email delivery. These providers process

service beyond moderation results.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

<h3>3.1 With Local Authorities</h3>
<p>When you submit a report, your name, email address, report description,
photos, and the GPS coordinates of the problem are shared with the local
government authority responsible for that location. This disclosure is
necessary for the authority to investigate, respond to, and resolve the
reported issue.</p>

<h3>3.2 Public Display</h3>
<p>Your report description, category, photos, location, and approximate
pin placement are published on the InfraSignal website so that other
residents can view reported problems and their status. You may choose to
hide your name from the public report page; however, your name and email
are always shared with the responsible authority.</p>

<h3>3.3 Service Providers</h3>
<p>We use third-party service providers to operate the Service (see
Section 1.3). These providers process data only as necessary to perform
their functions and are contractually bound to protect your
