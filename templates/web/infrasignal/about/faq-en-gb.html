    <dt>Do I need an account?</dt>
    <dd>You must provide a valid email address when submitting a report so
    that InfraSignal can send a confirmation link and deliver status updates.
    You may also create a full account to manage all your reports and
    subscriptions from one dashboard.</dd>

    <dt>Can I upload photos?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. You may attach up to 3 photos per report. Photos are
    automatically screened for inappropriate content before being
    published.</dd>

    <dt>Can I report anonymously?</dt>
    <dd>You may choose to hide your name from the public-facing report page.
    However, your name and email address are always shared with the
    responsible local authority so they can investigate and, if needed,
    contact you about the issue.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>After Submitting</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>How are reports delivered to local authorities?</dt>
    <dd>Reports are sent via email to the designated contact address for the
    responsible local authority. Each report includes the problem location
    (coordinates and address), the selected category, your description,
    any attached photos, and your contact information.</dd>

    <dt>How are reports prioritized?</dt>
    <dd>InfraSignal assigns one of four priority levels to each report:
    <strong>Emergency</strong> (immediate safety hazard),
    <strong>High</strong> (needs attention within 24 hours),
    <strong>Normal</strong> (standard response time), and
    <strong>Low</strong> (non-urgent). Local authorities can adjust priority
    as part of their investigation.</dd>

    <dt>How long will it take to fix my problem?</dt>
    <dd>Response times depend on the category, severity, and the local
    authority&rsquo;s workload. InfraSignal does not control how quickly
    authorities respond; it enables you to track your report&rsquo;s status
    and receive email updates when action is taken.</dd>

    <dt>How do I check the status of my report?</dt>
    <dd>You will receive email notifications when the status changes. You can
    also log in to your account and view all your reports under
    <strong>Your account</strong>. Each report shows its current status:
    open, investigating, in progress, fixed, or closed.</dd>

    <dt>What if my problem has not been addressed?</dt>
    <dd>You can post an update on your existing report at any time to provide
    additional photos, note that the problem persists, or add new details.
    The responsible authority is notified of each update.</dd>

    <dt>Can I see reports submitted by others?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. The <a href="/reports">All Reports</a> page displays all public
    reports with their status, location, and category. You can browse by area
    or search for specific locations.</dd>

    <dt>Can I get alerts about problems near me?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. Visit <a href="/alert">Local Alerts</a> to subscribe to email
    notifications for new reports in your area. You can set alerts by
    geographic radius or by specific local authority.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>For Local Authorities</h2>
