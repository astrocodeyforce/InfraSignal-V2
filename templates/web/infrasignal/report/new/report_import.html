<p>You may inject problem reports into InfraSignal programatically using this
simple interface. Upon receipt, an email will be sent to the address given,
with a link the user must click in order to check the details of their report,
add any other information they wish, and then submit to the local authority.

<p>This interface returns a plain text response; either <samp>SUCCESS</samp> if
the report has been successfully received, or if not, a list of errors, one per
line each starting with <samp>ERROR:</samp>.
